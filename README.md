This cookbook provides a profile resource along with direct command execution.

```ruby
duply_profile "profile_name" do
  destination "file:///var/backups/test"
  encrypt_for [ keys['server'][:key_id], keys['alice'][:key_id], keys['bob'][:key_id] ]
  signed_by   keys['server'][:key_id]
  passphrase  keys['server'][:passphrase]
  compression :bzip2
  volume_size 50
  keep_full   5
  full_every  '2M'
  includes [
      '/etc/duply'
  ]
  excludes [
      '**.asc'
  ]
  pre_commands [
    'date'
  ]
  post_commands [
    'date'
  ]
  # additional_params = ""
end
```

It is also possible to use Swift (OpenStack) as storage backend and to choose traditional symmetric GPG encryption only.

```ruby
duply_profile 'swift' do
  destination 'swift://backup'
  passphrase 'testpass'
  swift_username 'swift_user123'
  swift_tenant 'swift_tenant123'
  swift_password 'swift_password123'
  swift_authurl 'https:/swift.example.com:5000/v2.0'
  includes [
      '/etc/duply'
  ]
  excludes [
      '**.asc'
  ]
end
```
Execute duply commands from the cookbook

```ruby
duply "test-incr" do
  profile "test"
  action :incremental
end
```
